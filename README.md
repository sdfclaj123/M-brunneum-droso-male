"immune_gene_qpcr_107.txt" and "immune_gene_qpcr.txt" include immune gene expression data from immune assay 1 and immune assay 2 respectively. 

Within "mating_latency_mb.txt" are data from mating latency assay.

"reproduction_SFP_Data.txt" contains data for accessing the reproductive potential (number of mates, number of offspring, etc.) and the SFP gene expression.

*****'Scripts'*****

This folder includes all scripts in Rmarkdown format (.Rmd; with detailed annotations) for data analyses.
